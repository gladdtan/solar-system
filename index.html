		<li>
		<h2 id="sun">Sun</h2>
		<p>A massive, glowing ball of hot gases at the center of our solar system. It provides the energy and light that make life on Earth possible and holds the entire solar system together with its gravity.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mercury">Mercury</h2>
		<p>The smallest and closest planet to the Sun. It has a rocky surface covered in craters, no atmosphere to speak of, and experiences extreme temperature changes between day and night.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="venus">Venus</h2>
		<p>Similar in size and structure to Earth but with a thick, toxic atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide. Its surface is extremely hot, hotter than Mercury, due to a runaway greenhouse effect.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="earth">Earth</h2>
		<p>The third planet from the Sun and the only known world to support life. It has a breathable atmosphere, liquid water on the surface, and a protective magnetic field.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mars">Mars</h2>
		<p>Known as the Red Planet because of its iron-rich dust. It has the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system and shows evidence that liquid water once flowed on its surface.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="jupiter">Jupiter</h2>
		<p>The largest planet, a gas giant made mostly of hydrogen and helium. It has a giant storm called the Great Red Spot and more than 90 moons, including Ganymede, the biggest moon in the solar system.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="saturn">Saturn</h2>
		<p>A gas giant famous for its stunning ring system made of ice and rock. It has dozens of moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere and liquid lakes of methane.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="uranus">Uranus</h2>
		<p>An ice giant with a pale blue-green color due to methane gas. It rotates on its side, making its seasons extreme and unusual. It's cold and distant, with faint rings and many moons.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="neptune">Neptune</h2>
		<p>The farthest planet from the Sun. Itâ€™s a deep blue ice giant with the strongest winds in the solar system. It also has faint rings and several moons, including the large moon Triton.</p>
